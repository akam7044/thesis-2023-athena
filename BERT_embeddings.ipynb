So it's a good place to see when you come to London and there's Buckingham Palace where the Queen lives and that's a good place. That's the Royal Family lives so you can come there. And there's other, there's Big Ben, the houses of Parliament where the government, the government are, British government are. So that's a good place to go and there's the London Eye where you can see the whole of London, you go and you can see the whole of London. So that's a good place to visit in London. Yeah, so if I was, I would probably, I would go by public transport then you would see how London really is and you would see the whole of London if you go in a bus or the transport you would see how London is. So I would advice you go on public transport buses and trains so you would really enjoy it. You would get on a like an open tour bus where you can see the whole of London and go around and it doesn't cost that much. So yeah, that's good. Yeah, you can see more of London, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay then. Well.\",\n",
              "       \" Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. So you want to know what places would be nice to visit in London? Yeah. Okay. Well, there are several places you could visit in London. As you know, the world famous Trafalgar Square. There is also the famous Oxford Street where people go a lot for shopping as well as places like Night's Bridge. But in and around London as well, apart from just those sightseeing areas, for me, I also like to look at areas where, you know, in and around London, like those places, there are also nice restaurants and theatres as well for you to go to, not just the sights. But, you know, place, yeah. I would recommend you go by tube because it's a bit quicker in terms of traveling time because of the traffic, really. Okay.\",\n",
              "       \" So this is your first time in London, you've never been here before. So what sort of things are you interested in? Some nice buildings. Well, London has many, many interesting buildings because the city has been around for a very long time. So perhaps you could start by going to the Tower of London, which is on the river. And that's originally a Roman building, which was... It's very nice, it's a bit expensive to get into, but you have to queue for a long while as well. But if you want modern buildings, then there are two places you can go. You can go to the city. City of London has many fine modern buildings. They're named after strange things. The one that looks like a giant cigar is in fact called the Gürkin. Richard Rogers was the architect for that one. There's another one which is in the shape of a walkie-talkie. And another one which is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top is called the Cheese Gracer. But the one that dominates the skyline, I think it's the tallest building in Europe, is the Shard, which was designed by an Italian architect. And you can take a lift up to... You can take a lift up to about two thirds of the way up and get fantastic views. You can also buy very expensive drinks there. Well, the tube is interesting. I know some tourists find it difficult to navigate on the tube. But once you get a hang of the connections and where you get off one station to transfer onto another line, it'll work for you. The bus is good for seeing what's going on outside and there are some very good tourist buses you can hop on and off. Like you can in most big cities, really. Good? Okay.\",\n",
              "       \" Okay, so I'm much very long than you're here. I came here for the first time, by the way from Russia. So, yeah. So, of course, you should visit Vismissar Abbey because of Big Ben Tower. It's a great pleasure to see. It's very beautiful and that bridges around are also very nice across the Thames River and then probably should have a walk towards to the London Eye, have a round on it and come along with a, I think, going to the Omega Tower bridge because it's quite beautiful as well, yeah. So, to their probably the better to go by bus and then by foot. Oh, yeah. From here is possible to go by bus. Okay, should they continue? Okay. No. Sorry? Favorite sport? I think it's no boarding for me. Yeah. Okay, okay, I hope so. Okay.\",\n",

I think that's a great way of seeing a lot of London. I would suggest, well buses more interesting because you see more but tubes are more direct and probably quicker for longer distances. So a bit of both, depending on whether you want to get somewhere fast or you want to have plenty of time and you want to see buildings as you travel around, buses are great. I think really. Yes, you don't see much on a tube, you see how other people dress and what they're like but you notice much of London really. You see a lot of buses out there. Okay, thank you, thank you.\",\n",

Oh sport, oh I'm a football fan, yes I must admit. For my sins I support and... Soccer. Yes, sure, yes. Soccer is a team game between 11 people on either side defending a goal which is with playing with a ball by foot. You can't touch with your hands trying to get the ball into the opponent's goal. Yes, it's an interesting game to try and explain. But not a bit of a creek. That's going to set up. Okay. Okay, thank you, thank you.\",\n",

The other place that is in the west of London is Hampton Court. Have you heard of that? Okay, then again in the centre of London there's the tallest building in Europe is called the Shard, above London Bridge Station, and then if you're right, yes. Well Hampton Court you can go by tube and also London Bridge, you can go by tube and also Tower Hill, so they're all very easily accessed. No, no, there are lots of people on both buses and tube, but I guess if you want to see the surrounding area, it's better to be on a bus, but it'll take a lot longer. Okay.\",\n",

Up in the university area is a fantastic collection of collectives sorts and then the Museum area of the Victoria and Albert and National Natural History and the Science Museum. I've right up near Hyde Park are very interesting and then if you go one thing that I've enjoyed doing in the past is to get the Docklands Light Railway through the Old Docklands which is now Canary Wharf in the New Industrial Area but you get a good above ground view of the redevelopment and it's very interesting in the Old Docks and the east of part of London so that's something a bit different.

I'll be make it difficult for you and say I prefer cricket but it could be football. Football not much so much because there is a very famous explanation of cricket about when people are in their out and when they're out they're in but it's a case of it's very interesting and amusing to read but it's quite a complicated game with a bowler and a fielding side trying to bowl out a side that's batting and trying to score runs and the objective is to score more runs from one side than the other but you can be caught out or bowled out or run out there are all sorts of intricacies but it's very time consuming it can go on for five days so it's a bit longer than a game of football. Okay shall I switch off?\",\n",

My parents came over before the war was built. They fled so we stayed in a refugee camp and then my parents worked in North Germany. Okay and I came to England when I met my husband. We met when I was in a pair for three months during my studies at university in Kiel and so we kept in touch and then we lived abroad for a few years and yeah so our life then was in the south of England and yeah we now live in the new forest which is a lovely area near South Empton, Bournemouth and it's beautiful with lots of ponies and cattle walking around freely.

But I would always say that it's good to go to the centre of London so maybe somewhere like Piccadilly Circus. There's a really nice restaurant there which are quite like going to which is called Zedelles and it's kind of a brazary so there's a cafe upstairs and you go downstairs and there's a massive old-style English kind of hall with lots of marble and nice tables and it's a Parisian-style restaurant and also there's a cocktail bar there but there's also jazz that plays I think it might be in the evening so while you're having a dinner they play music. So that's a really lovely place. Yeah. So all of the museums are free in London which is great and so in that similar area which is kind of around Trafalgar Square is the National Portrait Gallery which is really beautiful and there's lots of floors and lots of different kinds of artwork and there is also another one. I can't quite remember the name but it's just opposite Green Park Station which is maybe one tube stop down from Piccadilly Circus and it's kind of hidden a bit further back and it's very nice there. If you're going from here you could take a bus. There's a bus just outside the front of the hospital or if you want to take the tube it's best to get to Elephant and Castle and then you can either take the Northern line or I think it's the Bakerloo line.

Yeah, so I have been practicing yoga so yeah. Okay, you mentioned about the okay. Yeah, I like yoga and I have been practicing yoga since 10 years ago and why I like yoga basically it helped me to relax and it also improved my flexibility. Yeah, and yeah, I would say that.

Yes, yes. Sorry, I didn't hear anything. If we need to see the Tower of Parliament where the Government says which is near Western Strabby, so you can do this in the town. What is nice is a trip down the river on one of the boats that you can get to the Tower and you go down and then you come to Greenwich, which is the nasal area. There's the Criticite there, which is a tea triff. There are also in Greenwich area, there's Queen Anne's house. A bus is the easiest way because you get a card, a card from certain shops, and you use the new seduance quite often, seldom. And then you can use that card all day and it will be useful when you enter it. And you can go into any shop and build it up, but the tube is easier if you want to go pretty quickly somewhere.

So, the best thing to do is Google a pub crawl. There are some absolutely fabulous pubs. They're wonderful. The architecture is great. You can go to some John Smith's pubs. They're fantastic.

Do you know when in London I always stay above ground. The architecture is lovely. The people have said not to be so friendly, but they are. You smile and say hello. They'll say hello back. I'd probably end up in a strange conversation at a bus stop. So, stay above ground. A bus, if it's a longer distance, keep a lookout.

In addition, you could just walk around and along the famous streets and like main roads such as Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus. Finally, you can walk by the river.
