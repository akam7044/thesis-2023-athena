139,ID07_pd_2_0_0_noPersonalQ.wav," Okay, well first of all welcome to London and some of the places that I would recommend are the British Museum.",1,1,0
140,ID07_pd_2_0_0_noPersonalQ.wav,Up in the university area is a fantastic collection of collectives sorts and then the Museum area of the Victoria and Albert and National Natural History and the Science Museum.,1,1,0
141,ID07_pd_2_0_0_noPersonalQ.wav,I've right up near Hyde Park are very interesting and then if you go one thing that I've enjoyed doing in the past is to get the Docklands Light Railway through the Old Docklands which is now Canary Wharf in the New Industrial Area but you get a good above ground view of the redevelopment and it's very interesting in the Old Docks and the east of part of London so that's something a bit different.,1,1,0
142,ID07_pd_2_0_0_noPersonalQ.wav,More to get to the British Museum and the Science Museum I would recommend the Tube but to go around the east end of London I would suggest going on the Docklands Light Railway.,1,1,0

148,ID07_pd_2_0_0.wav,I'll be make it difficult for you and say I prefer cricket but it could be football.,1,0,1
149,ID07_pd_2_0_0.wav,Football not much so much because there is a very famous explanation of cricket about when people are in their out and when they're out they're in but it's a case of it's very interesting and amusing to read but it's quite a complicated game with a bowler and a fielding side trying to bowl out a side that's batting and trying to score runs and the objective is to score more runs from one side than the other but you can be caught out or bowled out or run out there are all sorts of intricacies but it's very time consuming it can go on for five days so it's a bit longer than a game of football.,1,0,1

166,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,But I would always say that it's good to go to the centre of London so maybe somewhere like Piccadilly Circus.,0,0,0
167,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,There's a really nice restaurant there which are quite like going to which is called Zedelles and it's kind of a brazary so there's a cafe upstairs and you go downstairs and there's a massive old-style English kind of hall with lots of marble and nice tables and it's a Parisian-style restaurant and also there's a cocktail bar there but there's also jazz that plays I think it might be in the evening so while you're having a dinner they play music.,0,0,0
168,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,So that's a really lovely place.,0,0,0
169,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,Yeah.,0,0,0

171,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,I can't quite remember the name but it's just opposite Green Park Station which is maybe one tube stop down from Piccadilly Circus and it's kind of hidden a bit further back and it's very nice there.,0,0,0

173,ID09_hc_0_0_0.wav,There's a bus just outside the front of the hospital or if you want to take the tube it's best to get to Elephant and Castle and then you can either take the Northern line or I think it's the Bakerloo line.,0,0,0
